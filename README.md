Instructions for using the TimeManager software:

In order to run the software, run "Main".

Notice that some functionalities require projects and or developers to be created first. 
For example you cannot assign a developer to a project, before first creating both the project and the developer. 
Also notice that some functionalities require the user to be Project manager. 
All of this should be quite clear by reading the error-messages, when using a given function.

In order to run the tests, including white box tests, run "CucumberTest".
